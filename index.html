    <p>
      A croissant is typically made of yeast-risen dough. The dough is first
      layered with butter and then rolled. It is folded many times in a process
      called lamination. Then the dough is cut into triangles, rolled to form a
      crescent shape and baked. Croissants Aren't Really French In fact,
      croissants are said to have been invented in Vienna, Austria. The tale
      goes that a baker created the crescent-shaped bread to celebrate the
      defeat of the Ottoman Empire, mirroring the crescent moon on the Turkish
      flag.
